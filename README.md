To scan a network using Nmap and export the results as an HTML file, you can follow these steps:

    Install Nmap: If you don't already have Nmap installed on your system, you can download it from the official Nmap website (https://nmap.org/) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

    Open a terminal or command prompt: Launch a terminal or command prompt window on your computer.

    Scan the network: Use the following Nmap command to scan the desired network:

    shell

nmap -A -T4 <target>

Replace <target> with the IP address range or hostname of the network you want to scan. For example, you can scan a specific subnet like 192.168.0.0/24 or an individual host like 192.168.0.1.

The -A flag enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute. The -T4 flag sets the scan speed to "Aggressive." You can adjust these options as per your requirements.

The scan may take some time depending on the network size and complexity.

Create a folder: Create a folder named "scan_net_temp" in your desired location. You can do this using the following command:

shell

mkdir scan_net_temp

This command will create a folder named "scan_net_temp" in the current directory.

Export the scan results as HTML: Use the -oX option in combination with a filename to export the scan results in XML format. Then, use the xsltproc command to transform the XML file into an HTML file. Run the following commands:

shell

    nmap -A -T4 -oX scan_net_temp/scan_results.xml <target>
    xsltproc scan_net_temp/scan_results.xml -o scan_net_temp/scan_results.html

    This will save the scan results as an XML file named "scan_results.xml" inside the "scan_net_temp" folder and then transform it into an HTML file named "scan_results.html" within the same folder.

    Open the HTML file: You can now open the "scan_results.html" file in a web browser to view the exported scan results.

Remember to replace <target> with the appropriate IP address range or hostname you wish to scan. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create folders and write files in your chosen location.

Please exercise caution and ensure that you are authorized to perform network scans on the target network.
